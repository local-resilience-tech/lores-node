# Toolkitty Node Files

Files in this directory are copied directly from the Toolkitty project (https://github.com/toolkitties/toolkitty), ideally without changes so that we can update them.

These files are [licensed under the GPL 3](https://github.com/toolkitties/toolkitty/blob/main/LICENSE). Copyright is owned by their respective authors.

It is not the intend of this project to use copied files forever, we hope to see the development of libraries that will replace this.
